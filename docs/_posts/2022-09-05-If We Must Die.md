--- If We Must Die ---
If we must die, let it not be like hogs
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,
Making their mock at our accursèd lot.
If we must die, O let us nobly die,
So that our precious blood may not be shed
In vain; then even the monsters we defy
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!
O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!
Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!
What though before us lies the open grave?
Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!</textarea>

<cite>If We Must Die</cite> is a poem written by Claude McKay in 1919. McKay was a Jamaican-American poet, novelist, and journalist. He was one of the first black writers to gain international recognition. He was also a member of the Harlem Renaissance, a movement of black writers and artists in the 1920s.

In this poem, McKay talks about the oppression he faced as a member of the black community. He refers to his oppressers as <q>monsters</q> and <q>[mad, hungry dogs]</q>. He also uses the metaphor of <q>hogs</q> to refer to the treatment of the black community, as they were treated like animals. McKay also calls the black community’s place in society an <q>inglorious spot</q> and suggests they were treated as an <q>accursed lot</q>. Therefore, the black community was treated disrepectfully and as if they were damned.

The poem is written in the form of a sonnet, which is a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme. Sonnets are traditionally written in iambic pentameter, which is a pattern of five stressed and five unstressed syllables per line. McKay’s poem follows this pattern, as can be seen in the following lines:

<blockquote>
If we must die, let it not be like hogs<br>
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,<br>
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,<br>
Making their mock at our accursèd lot.
