<cite>Dull Knives</cite> is a song by the pop rock band <cite>Imagine Dragons</cite>, founded in 2008. <cite>Imagine Dragons</cite> was <cite>Spotify</cite>’s most-streamed music creator in 2018 and is the first rock band to have four songs individually surpassing one billion streams.

In this song, the singer uses the metaphorical device <q>dull knives</q> to express a hidden feeling of ongoing depression; a dull knife would take a long time to cut through an object, if at all. This is a metaphorical symbol because the “knives” are not physical, and therefore are not killing him physically, but are instead causing the singer to <q>lose [his] mind.</q>

This song uses rhyme to blend the lines, making it easier to listen to. Some of the rhyming structure is repeated, such as the 'AAAABBAA' pattern in the first verse. Also in the first verse, an oxymoron is used. The lyrics <q>nothing is wrong</q> and <q>nothing is right</q> are referring to what the singer tells other people and what he feels respective.

One of my favourite qualities of this song is the use of the musical element 'intensity'. This is where different parts of a song are performed louder or softer to give meaning. This is most noticeable in the chorus, where the singer yells the lyrics, indicating extreme genuineness and desperation.

All these devices combined create a sense of chaos and overwhelming, where the singer feels his psychological health is uncontrollably spiralling downwards. He even seems to believe he can’t go on for much longer, begging that <q>someone [would] please save [his] life.</q>

<hr>

Overall, this song excellently conveys the struggles caused by society’s neglect of depressive symptoms. It tells of a man who <q>inside [is] a mess, but [doesn’t] let it show,</q> and makes heavy use of the musical element of intensity to emphasise the seriousness of the message.
